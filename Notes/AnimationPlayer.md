# AnimationPlayer

- Summary
  - Creates animation based on the changes of the chosen Nodes (any __non-animated__ node)
  - Uses keyframes to animate, each keyframe of each node has the state of that node at that frame
  - Select the ```Animation``` tab (bottom) or ```AnimationPlayer``` node and choose the node to animate -> change state -> add keyframe (key icon next to property)

- Notes
  - Best to use 1 spritesheet for all animations (don't have to set new spritesheet for every animations)
